    "#### In the last notebook, you got familiar with the kinetics related to the curing of thermoset polymers. This time, the focus will be on flow-related topics of such polymers. This is applicable to several manufacturing techniques you heard of in the lectures, like liquid composite moulding. This area of study is called rheology, and it plays a fundamental role in the manufacturing of polymers, serving as a crucial scientific discipline that governs the viscosity, flow and deformation behavior of polymer materials. Deep knowledge of rheology is indispensable to work in polymer composite manufacturing. This field enables control of material behavior and improved quality of produced parts.\n",
